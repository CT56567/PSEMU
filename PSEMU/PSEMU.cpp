/*
 * Somehow get the DMA Working.
 * The DMA needs access to the register and the memory so if put DMA in the CPU and then pass the memory and registers I can allow DMA to work.
 * That was the first part but the second part is to be able to map it.
 *
 * Also, All the CPU Registers have the same value somehow. EDIT: nvm I fixed it, turns out I hadn't initialized all the CPURegister array to 0.
 *
 * Ok, I found a way to fix the DMA Circular Dependencies, I can just merge the DMA with the Memory.
 * I finally got it working.
 * 
 * Priorities:
 * [ ] Get GPU working
 * [ ] Make the Renderer and look at these functions that use it
 * - gp0_fill_rect
 * [X] Implement Tick.
 * [ ] Add Proper Memory
 * 
 * Just a note, I'm not sure if it's nessairy or not but other emulators seem to be starting at a specific address but mine just starts at zero.
 * Also I think we need to use a tick
 * I think the j instruction at the end uses the DMA.
 * 
 * NOTE: The gpu tick is not implemented
