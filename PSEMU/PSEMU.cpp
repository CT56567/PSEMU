/*
 * Somehow get the DMA Working.
 * The DMA needs access to the register and the memory so if put DMA in the CPU and then pass the memory and registers I can allow DMA to work.
 * That was the first part but the second part is to be able to map it.
 *
 * Also, All the CPU Registers have the same value somehow. EDIT: nvm I fixed it, turns out I hadn't initialized all the CPURegister array to 0.
 * Ok, so I have gotton the first part right.
